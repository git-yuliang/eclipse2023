# eclipse2023

These Jupyter Notebook documents and scripts demonstrate the processing and analysis of observational data collected during the total solar eclipse of 2023.

# Input data:

The SDO/AIA data, the $H_{\alpha}$ image observed by the Learmonth Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), the $TiO\ 7057\ \text{Ã…}$ image obtained using the Educational Adaptive-optics Solar Telescope (EAST) at the Shanghai Astronomy Museum, China, is availiable at \url{https://github.com/git-yuliang/eclipse2023/tree/main/input/EAST/7057}.
The white-light coronal data from the 2023 total solar eclipse, captured using an iPhone, are available on Figshare via the private link: \url{https://figshare.com/s/91053c9b87dcff703be1} and will be made public upon article acceptance.
Given the substantial volume of white-light coronal data, the file paths were not stored in the default directory (\texttt{./input/*}) but were instead saved in the local environment. In the code, we specified the path as \texttt{/Volumes/WD1T/share/TSE2023/iPhone/}. To rerun the results, please download the dataset and update the path to match your local directory structure.

### **Notebook Overview**

The primary objectives of this Notebook include:

1. Preprocessing of raw white-light corona imaging data (dark field subtraction, flat field correction, and temporal registration).
2. Application of wavelet analysis to detect high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs).
3. Visualizations of the solar corona and statistical results for Sun-as-a-star analysis.

The analysis relies on the following Python libraries (compatible versions):

- `numpy==1.2.43`
- `pandas==1.5.1`
- `scikit-image==0.20.0`
- `matplotlib==3.7.1`
- `astropy==5.1.1`
- `opencv-python==4.7.0.72`
- `Pillow==9.2.0`
- `scipy==1.13.1`

<!-- A complete list of dependencies can be found in the accompanying `requirements.txt`. -->
